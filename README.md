# Craps Calculator

Determine the ideal bet amount to receive a whole number payout that aligns with the table's minimum bet requirement.

For instance, a $10 [Place Bet](https://wizardofodds.com/games/craps/basics/#place) on the *six* pays $11.67. The casino doesn't deal with change, so you would only receive $11. 

By utilizing this calculator, you can see that with a minimum bet of $10, you should wager $12 to ensure you receive a complete, even-dollar payout of $14.
